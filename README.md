# Infinity ErgoDox layout and Kiibohd kll compiler

My customized layout using [hlship's project](https://github.com/hlship/ergodox-infinity-layout) which was forked and customized from [fredZen's project](https://github.com/fredZen/ergodox-infinity-layout) via 

My layout for the [Infinity ErgoDox](http://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox) keyboard.

This is the basic layout:

The [KLL Spec](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zzqbdwqjfwwf) explains how to do more advanced customizations.

## Workflow

The Docker image used by the compile script is available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fmerizen/ergodox-infinity-layout/).

1. Edit the `ergodox-*.kll` files in the `kiibohd` folder
2. When adding or removing a layer, change the value of PartialMaps in `kiibohd/ergodox.bash` accordingly
3. Run `make compile`
4. The compiled firmware is now available as files `kiibohd/left_kiibohd.dfu.bin` and `kiibohd/right_kiibohd.dfu.bin`
5. Flash the keyboard (see below)

It's enough to flash the master half of the keyboard (the one that's plugged into the host computer).
However, you might be surprised if you ever switch the master to the other half -- your layout is
determined by the firmware of the master half; keeping both halves in sync may spare you a lot
of confusion.

## Flashing

You need to install [dfu-util](https://github.com/kiibohd/controller/wiki/Loading-DFU-Firmware).  For me, this was `brew install dfu-util`.

Place your keyboard into flash mode, by hitting the switch on the bottom of the PCB, or using a key sequence that enables flashing.

Execute `make install`:

```
18:56:59 ~/workspaces/github/ergodox-infinity-layout > make install
dfu-util -D kiibohd/left_kiibohd.dfu.bin
dfu-util 0.9

Optionally, switch your cables to make the other side the master, and use the command `make install-right`.
